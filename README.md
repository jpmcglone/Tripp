# Tripp

## About this app

- It uses Swift Package Manager. You should be able to pull it down, wait for SPM, then build
- Uses external libraries `Alamofire` and `SDWebImageSwiftUI`
- I had to go to bed, so I only built the initial service and the fetch screen
- You do not have to hit enter when searching. I'm using Combine's `.debounce` so it will search if you stop typing for 0.25 seconds

### Thanks for checking it out. 

I'll clean up the code here when I have time :)
